# Kittens API

## Overview

Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api) as part of the APIs section of the Ruby on Rails course.

While simple, this project provided experience setting up a data-producing API using Rails. Using the respond_to method within the controller, the app is now able to work as both the normal HTML-producing back end as well as an API which can be used to pull json data from it.
